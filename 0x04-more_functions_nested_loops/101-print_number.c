/**
* print_number - outputs a number

* Description: Uses headers to link and a nested loops to achieve goal
* Return: no return is void
* A: The case when n is zero
* B: I set places to be 1 billion initially. If it was bigger than the
* number then I reduce places by a factor of 10 until it is small
* enough to do nice math.
* E: If the number is negative I will convert it to a positive
* and print a minus sign. Then proceed with the code as normal.
